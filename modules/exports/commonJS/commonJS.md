# CommonJS (CJS)

CommonJS is a set of standards first imagined by Mozilla engineer Kevin Dangoor in 2009,
and which have since been used as the default way to implement modules on server-side JavaScript programs,
such as in the NodeJS environment.

# CommonJS modules are NOT supported by browsers environments.

By default, [.js] files in NodeJS are considered CommonJS modules.
